Feature:
  In order to find content in the DAM
  As a reviewer
  I need to browse different facets

  Scenario: Review status and 4-digit year facet (DAM-152,154)
    Given I am logged in as "reviewer1@example.com"
    Then I should see a facet for "Status"
    And I should see the facet term "yes"
    And I should see a facet for "Year"
    And I should see the facet term "2007"

  Scenario: Priority facet (DAM-155)
    Given I am logged in as "reviewer1@example.com"
    Then I should see a facet for "Priority"
    And I should see the facet term "normal"
    And I should see the facet term "high"

  Scenario: Reveiwer facet (DAM-158)
    Given I am logged in as "reviewer1@example.com"
