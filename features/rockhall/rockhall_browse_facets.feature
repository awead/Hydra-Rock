Feature:
  In order to find content in the DAM
  As a public user
  I need to browse different facets

  Scenario:
    Given I am on the home page
    Then I should see "Springsteen, Bruce"
    And I should see "Grealish, Darren"
    And I should see "Rock music--History and criticism."
    And I should see "Rock concert films."
