Feature: Ingest videos
  In order to ingest digital videos into Hydra
  As as archivist
  Submit bags of video

Narrative:
  We'll receive video from either vendors or internall that has been organized into a BagIt
  structure.  These packages (SIPs) will be verified, prepared and ingested using methods
  executed from a command line and rake environment.  Once the video is successfully ingested
  there will be objects that exist in Hydra ready for viewing and editing.

  Scenario: Video is not publically available immediately following ingest

  Scenario: Members of the archivist group have edit rights

  Scenario: View all the fields of the original preservation video file
