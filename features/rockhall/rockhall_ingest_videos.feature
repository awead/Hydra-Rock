Feature: Ingest videos
  In order to ingest digital videos into Hydra
  As as archivist
  Submit bags of video

Narrative:
  We'll receive video from either vendors or internall that has been organized into a BagIt
  structure.  These packages (SIPs) will be verified, prepared and ingested using methods
  executed from a command line and rake environment.  Once the video is successfully ingested
  there will be objects that exist in Hydra ready for viewing and editing.

  Scenario: Video is not publically available immediately following ingest
    Given I am on the show document page for rockhall:fixture_pbcore_document3
    Then I should see "You do not have sufficient access privileges to read this document, which has been marked private."

  Scenario: Members of the archivist group have edit rights (DAM-131)
    Given I am logged in as "archivist1@example.com"
    And I am on the edit archival video page for rockhall:fixture_pbcore_document3
    Then I should see "Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame. The craft. Jim James. @ the Belly Up, San Diego. Main mix, stereo. Part 2 of 2."
    When I follow "Original"
    And the following should be selected within "fieldset#original_fields"
