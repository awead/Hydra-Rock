Feature:
  In order to control who has access to what content
  As a reviewer
  I need to apply the correct kind of license to an object


Description:
  Videos and other digital assets that are ingested in to Hydra may need to be reviewed by
  members of the Museum staff to determine what level of access is required or available.
  Hydra should allow these users to specify these access levels and indicate whether or not
  these objects have been reviewed.

  Scenario: Reviewer logs in and checks the status of an item (DAM-123)
    Given I am logged in as "archivist1@example.com"
    And I am on the show document page for rockhall:fixture_pbcore_document3
    Then I should see the heading "Review Information"
    And I should see the field title "reviewer" contain "Reviewer"
    And I should see the field content "reviewer" contain "reviewer1@example.com"
    And I should see the field title "date_completed" contain "Date Completed"
    And I should see the field content "date_completed" contain "2011-11-29"
    And I should see the field title "date_updated" contain "Date Updated"
    And I should see the field content "date_updated" contain "2011-11-29"
    And I should see the field title "license" contain "License"
    And I should see the field content "license" contain "Rockhall"
    And I should see the field title "abstract" contain "Abstract"
    And I should see the field content "abstract" contain "We don't have permission to show this to the public"
