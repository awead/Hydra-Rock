<h1> Info </h1>
<p>
Hydra is an open-source digital asset management system that utilizes Fedora repository
software to store digital content, and a Solr index for searching.
</p>
<h1> Content </h1>
We're currently using Hydra to manage two main types of content:

<h3> Archival Video </h3>
<p>
This is video content which exists on a physical tape such as BetacamSP, Mini-DV or
U-matic.  The video itself can either be analog or digital, and in either
standard definition or high-definition.  The key feature for this type of content is
that it starts out on a tape that you hold in your hand.
</p>
<p>
From there, the tape is digitized if it is analog, or transferred to disk if it
already exists as digital content.  Once it is digitized or transferred to disk, the
original file is kept as the preservation copy while a second compressed copy is made
for web access.  Both copies are managed by Hydra and cataloged by the
staff of the Library and Archives.
</p>

<h3> Digital Video </h3>

Archival content which is considered "born digital" and includes:
<ol>
  <li>video files on a hard disk</li>
  <li>digital video that is stored on a medium which will not be kept for archival storage</li>
</ol>
<p>
The video may be in any originating format and in either standard or high definition.
</p>
<p>
Born digital content is transferred to disk and arranged according to archival procedures
for storing and preserving digital content.  Once rendred to disk, the original content
may exist in one or more parts.  Each part will be available in two formats, one a
high-quality master file, usually uncompressed, and a second, lower-quality surrogate
file for web access.
</p>
<p>
All files will be managed by Hydra and cataloged by the staff of the Library and
Archives
</p>

<h1> Uses </h1>
<p>
Museum staff may request downloaded copies of any file for use with Musuem-related projects
or for use with outside members of the media, such as requests for video content
from news agencies.
