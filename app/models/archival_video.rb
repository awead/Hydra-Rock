  # This a working model used for storing video objects in Fedora.  Comments above each
  # section below explain the elements at work.  A more general example of creating models
  # in Hydra can be found here:
  #
  #  https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Models---Defining-a-Custom-Hydra-Model
  #
  # Many of the modeling strategies used here are also outlined in the above page that
  # describes creating a custom model in a more general fashion.

  # These are include statement that mix in other functions referenced in other
  # libraries.  The libraries come from the ActiveFedora gem, Hydra and our own
  # local Rockhall libraries.  You can mix in model methods from any gem or library,
  # such as ActiveModel.  The extent of the mixins is completely up to your own needs.

  # ActiveFedora implements callbacks just like ActiveRecord does and you can specify
  # them here.  #apply_default_permissions is a particular method in our local Rockhall
  # library, which is found in Rockhall::ModelMethods.
  after_create :apply_default_permissions

  # Fedora relationships between objects that are found in the RELS-EXT datastream are
  # defined here. By including the ActiveFedora::Relationships mixin above, we can use any
  # of the standard Fedora relationships to link our objects together.  For more
  # information on using these relationships, see the documentation on ActiveFedora. Here,
  # we use the AchivalVideo object to act as a parent object to which other objects can
  # assert an "isPartOf" relationship.  The fact that it is "inbound" means that the
  # relationship is incoming from another object, like inbound traffic coming in from
  # somewhere.
  has_relationship "objects", :is_part_of, :inbound => true

  # This is the essential "meat" section of our model where we actually define which
  # datastreams are in our objects and what's in them.  The name of the datastream is
  # how it will appear in the object's FOXML, the type refers to its content.  The
  # datastreams listed below are all xml datastreams that use an OM terminology to
  # define their terms.
