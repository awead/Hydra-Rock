module Rockhall::Conversion

  # Converts our old models to new ones.  Old ArchivalVideo and DigitalVideo objects are merged into one
  # kind of new ArchivalVideo object.  Old ArchivalVideo objects are reorganized to have no instantiations
  # and instead have them linked as related objects.  All objects have pboreRelation nodes for collection 
  # and series removed, replaced with linked objects for ArchivalCollection and ArchivalSeries.  Xml validation
  # errors are corrected, and ExternalVideos are simplified to only inlcude the pbcoreInstantiation node and
  # no parent nodes.

  # Converts an old ArchivalVideo model to new one.
  #  - removes pbcoreInstantation and created new linked ExternalVideo object
  #  - removes pbcoreRelation nodes for archival collections and series, creates appropriate linked objects
  #  - cleans up xml validation errors
